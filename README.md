### Migrate the tables

to display some data you shoud open your terminal, locate and enter this project
directory and run the following command

### Generate some test data

Once you have all your database tables setup you can then generate some test data
which will come from our pre-made database table seeders.
In order to do so, in your terminal run the following command

``php artisan db:seed``

N.B. If you run this command twice, all the test data will be duplicated and added to the existing table data, if you want to avoid having duplicate test data please
make sure to ``truncate`` the following ``datafeeds`` table in your database.

### Compile the front-end

Then run ``npm run dev`` in the terminal to run a development server to re-compile static assets when making changes to the template.

When you have done with changes, run ``npm run build`` for compiling and minify for production.

### Launch the Laravel backend

can run the following command in your terminal window.

``php artisan serve``

You should receive a message similar to this
``Starting Laravel development server: http://127.0.0.1:8000`` simply copy the URL
in your browser and you'll be ready to test out your new mosaic laravel app.
